```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
**Solution:**
1. **Increase color contrast:** Choose `from` and `to` colors that offer more distinct visual separation.  This will make the gradient more noticeable.
2. **Experiment with direction:** Try different `to-*` values (e.g., `to-br`, `to-tl`) to find a direction that effectively displays the gradient.
3. **Test different color palettes:**  Explore different color combinations. Tools like Coolors.co can help with selecting complementary colors.
4. **Ensure proper container sizing:**  Make sure the element containing the gradient has defined width and height.  Missing dimensions can lead to unexpected rendering.
5. **Use gradient utilities with caution:** Be mindful of potential conflicts or unexpected behaviors when using gradients with other Tailwind CSS utilities.
