This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature, but might produce unexpected results if the `from` and `to` colors are too similar or if the direction is not clearly defined.  In some cases, the gradient might appear subtle or even invisible.  Additionally, gradients can sometimes cause unexpected layout issues if not carefully handled.
